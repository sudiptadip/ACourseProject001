            <p>
                It is Top Classes’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
                operating our website. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personally
                identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy
                policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we
                use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third
                parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does
                not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
            </p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the
                general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when

            <P><strong>Website Visitors</strong></P>

            <p>
                Like most website operators, Top Classes collects non-personally identifying information of the
                sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Top Classes’ purpose
                in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Top Classes’
                visitors use its website. From time to time, Top Classes may release non-personally identifying
                information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
                website.
            </p>

            <p>
                Top Classes also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol
                (IP) addresses for logged-in users . Top Classes only discloses logged-in users and IP addresses
                under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
                described below.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>

            <p>
                Certain visitors to Top Classes’ website choose to interact with Top Classes in ways that require
                Top Classes to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
                that Top Classes gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
                who sign up for a blog at our website to provide a username and email address.
